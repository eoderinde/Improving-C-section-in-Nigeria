Improving Nigeria’s Caesarean Section Services: The Data Science Role.

Introduction
This project talked about the “BIG picture” of Data Science through a maternal healthcare case study of Caesarean-section (CS). How
Number of available Doctors, Nurses and Midwives, with respect to
Location, and 
Type of Management
Emergency Transports 
could impact on the rendering of C-section.

Problem Statement
It will surprise you, the distance apart in kilometers (km) that women in need of Caesarean Section Operation in Nigeria might have to travel due to the absence of a Hospital capable of performing this operation within there neighborhood.

To us, this is a big problem that needs serious and urgent attention.

Goals and Objectives
Our goal is to take the data and generate actionable insights that we can use to take data driven actions.


Actions:
Government and the private bodies should build Hospitals rendering C-Section in areas where they are scantily available e.g. war ravaged north eastern region
